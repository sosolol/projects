# Zes Projects

This is a haul of almost all my projects throughout the years (2019-2024)

## Getting Started

Most of these projects use Node.JS and will require a latest build, if some of the projects don't work you may need to install required modules.

### Prerequisites

Listed below are the mainly required software needed.

```
[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
[Python](https://www.python.org/)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
```

### Installing

A step by step on how to install required modules.

```
If the project you're installing has a "Package.json" file, you will need to run command "npm i" whilst inside the directory. This will install all the required packages for this project.

If the project you're install has a "Requirements.txt" file, you will need to run command "pip install -r requirements.txt" whilst inside the directory. This will install all the required packages for this project.
